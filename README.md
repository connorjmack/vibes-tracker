# YouTube Hive-Mind Analyzer 🐝

## Project Overview
This AI agent is designed to monitor and analyze narrative trends across custom-defined clusters of YouTube channels (e.g., "Tech Reviewers," "Manosphere").

It uses:
* YouTube Data API for ingestion.
* LLMs (Gemini/GPT) for intelligent topic extraction and summarization.
* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for deep, searchable analysis of video transcripts.

## Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:** `git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>`
2.  **Setup Environment:** (TBD: Will involve creating a virtual environment and installing requirements.)
3.  **Authentication:** Get a YouTube API Key and save it in a `.env` file.
